> While SlackDevs Docs aims to redefine how documentation is created, managed, and deployed, we openly acknowledge that our journey involves a learning curve with the technologies at our core. As a team new to the integration of Mkdocs Material and Directus Headless CMS, it's possible that early versions of our platform may exhibit practices that are not ideal. We are committed to continuous improvement and will actively refine our methods and codebase to adhere to best practices. Feedback and contributions from our community are invaluable as we evolve. Together, we'll shape SlackDevs Docs into a benchmark for documentation excellence.

> Currently, SlackDevs Docs provides support exclusively for the community edition of Mkdocs Material. We understand the growing demand for features available in the Mkdocs Material Insiders version and are committed to incorporating this support in future updates. Our immediate focus is on ensuring a stable and robust experience with the community edition. As we refine our platform and expand its capabilities, we plan to extend our support to the Insiders edition, embracing a broader range of features and enhancements. We appreciate your patience and support as we work towards this goal, striving to make SlackDevs Docs a comprehensive tool for documentation management.
